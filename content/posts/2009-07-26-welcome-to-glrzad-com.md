summary: "Welcome to glrzad.com, formerly rad-ev.com. It's been quite a while since I've maintained a blog but I feel that now is a good time to get back to blogging. I wish I had some of my old articles/tutorials from rad-ev.com but I think their long gone, maybe I'll do some digging to see if I can find them."

<p>Welcome to glrzad.com, formerly rad-ev.com. It's been quite a while since I've maintained a blog but I feel that now is a good time to get back to blogging. I wish I had some of my old articles/tutorials from rad-ev.com but I think their long gone, maybe I'll do some digging to see if I can find them.</p>

<p>Things are still a little under construction here, but feel free to poke around. I have quite a few ideas floating around in my head to write, some I've already begun working on while others are just in early stages. So stay tuned for updates.</p>
