summary: "Updates to the CSS3 Gradient Generator, including color format selection and UI improvements."

Along with these changes the public github repository has been restructured. Only the important things (the JavaScript source of course) are up in the repo. Meaning, you can go ahead and browse it, fork it, learn how it works or use in your own project. Be warned that a lot of the code is pretty specific to the HTML structure of the actual gradients.glrzad.com website. It was never intended to be used as a plugin, though perhaps
