Welcome to the overhaul of my site. I've migrated over from glrzad.com and Wordpress to a custom built CMS, built using Ruby on Rails. For more info head over to the [About](/about) section for more details. I'm aiming to keep more active on here than before logging my work and experiments more often.

## Work

Along with the my site refresh there are a few other projects that are in the works, some new and some old.

### [CSS Factory](http://www.css3factory.com)

I've begun work on my newest project, the [CSS3 Factory](http://www.css3factory.com). I plan on building out a suite of tools for live CSS3 testing and more so stay tuned.

### [CSS3 Gradient Generator](http://gradients.glrzad.com)

The CSS3 Gradient Generator is also in the midst of getting an overhaul. As part of building up the CSS3 Factory, I will be moving the CSS3 Gradient Generator to live as part of the CSS3 Factory.
