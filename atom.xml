One of the most time-consuming parts was compiling the Design History File (DHF) — the set of artifacts that describe how the system was built and tested. A central piece of that file is the Software Design Specification (SDS), which describes the behavior, design, and rationale for each component in the system.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My Journey into 3D Printing with the Bambu Labs P1S</title><link>https://damiangalarza.com/posts/2025-04-01-my-journey-into-3d-printing/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://damiangalarza.com/posts/2025-04-01-my-journey-into-3d-printing/</guid><description>&lt;p>Over the years 3D printing has become more and more common.

&lt;p>In the ever-evolving world of web development, choosing the right technology
stack is crucial for building efficient and maintainable applications. We moved away
from React and GraphQL, opting instead for traditional REST APIs and Rails-based
views, leveraging the power of the &lt;a href="https://viewcomponent.org/">ViewComponents gem&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-initial-tech-stack-react-and-graphql">The initial tech stack: React and GraphQL&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Buoy Software&amp;rsquo;s journey began with a mobile application built using React Native
and powered by a GraphQL API in a Ruby on Rails application. The success of this
project led us to adopt similar technologies for our web application, resulting
in a React based front-end using webpacker. This approach allowed for code reuse
and consistency across platforms, which seemed like an ideal solution at the time.
For our small team, it was easier to maintain a shared pattern when moving
between the React Native application and our web application.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Acceptance Tests with Subdomains</title><link>https://damiangalarza.com/posts/2016-10-10-acceptance-tests-with-subdomains/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Oct 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://damiangalarza.com/posts/2016-10-10-acceptance-tests-with-subdomains/</guid><description>&lt;p>This post was originally published on the &lt;a href="https://thoughtbot.com/blog/acceptance-tests-with-subdomains">thoughtbot blog&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The Rails &lt;code>fresh_when&lt;/code> method is a powerful tool for conditionally caching resources via HTTP. However there are some pitfalls. For one, &lt;code>fresh_when&lt;/code> only supports the default render flow in a controller; if a client&amp;rsquo;s cache is not fresh, it will just render the related view. We cannot utilize things like &lt;code>render json:&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fortunately, Rails provides us with more tools to work with HTTP conditional caching. Some of the basics behind HTTP conditional caching are assumed in this post. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t already, or you just need a refresher take a look at &lt;a href="https://damiangalarza.com/posts/2014-11-25-introduction-to-conditional-http-caching-with-rails/">Introduction to Conditional HTTP Caching with Rails&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Introduction to Conditional HTTP Caching with Rails</title><link>https://damiangalarza.com/posts/2014-11-25-introduction-to-conditional-http-caching-with-rails/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://damiangalarza.com/posts/2014-11-25-introduction-to-conditional-http-caching-with-rails/</guid><description>&lt;p>This post was originally published on the &lt;a href="https://thoughtbot.com/blog/introduction-to-conditional-http-caching-with-rails">thoughtbot blog&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>HTTP provides developers with a powerful set of tools to cache responses. Often times we don&amp;rsquo;t want a client to blindly cache content that it has been given. We may not be able to rely on setting specific expiration headers either. Instead we need a way for the client to ask the server whether or not a resource has been updated.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>HTTP provides us with the ability to do this with conditional caching. A client can make a request to the server and find out of the server has a new version of the resource available.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Scaling JSON APIs in Rails using ActiveModel::Serializers, Key-Based Caching, and Rack::Cache</title><link>https://damiangalarza.com/posts/scaling-json-apis-in-rails/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Nov 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://damiangalarza.com/posts/scaling-json-apis-in-rails/</guid><description>A guide on building high-scale JSON APIs in Rails using ActiveModel::Serializers, Key-Based Caching, and Rack::Cache.

So this is part one of an iPhone web application piece that I am working on. While I am it, let me point out what the scope of this article is. This article is not about how to write an iPhone web application. It does not go into details on the syntax or use of technologies for the iPhone. It does explain some of the misconceptions between iPhone applications, iPhone targeted websites, and finally, iPhone Web Applications. I do plan to write more about the iPhone web application technologies and provide some examples and working code, but that is all currently beyond the scope of this article.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While researching on the topic over the last few weeks, I discovered what I believe is a misconception of an iPhone web application, and my goal is to hopefully, clear things up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let’s start by defining some of the possible ways of targeting an iPhone user, which actually diverges into two separate categories of its own. The first and probably the most popular way of targeting an iPhone user is through an iPhone app, sold through the iTunes App store. Coding and compiling Objective C/Cocoa based native iPhone applications.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yet there are still other ways of creating a custom user experience for a user on the iPhone.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Welcome to glrzad.com</title><link>https://damiangalarza.com/posts/2009-07-26-welcome-to-glrzad-com/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jul 2009 18:03:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://damiangalarza.com/posts/2009-07-26-welcome-to-glrzad-com/</guid><description>Welcome to glrzad.com, formerly rad-ev.com.
