&lt;p&gt;In the ever-evolving world of web development, choosing the right technology
stack is crucial for building efficient and maintainable applications. We moved away
from React and GraphQL, opting instead for traditional REST APIs and Rails-based
views, leveraging the power of the &lt;a href="https://viewcomponent.org/"&gt;ViewComponents gem&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-initial-tech-stack-react-and-graphql"&gt;The initial tech stack: React and GraphQL&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buoy Software&amp;rsquo;s journey began with a mobile application built using React Native
and powered by a GraphQL API in a Ruby on Rails application. The success of this
project led us to adopt similar technologies for our web application, resulting
in a React based front-end using webpacker. This approach allowed for code reuse
and consistency across platforms, which seemed like an ideal solution at the time.
For our small team, it was easier to maintain a shared pattern when moving
between the React Native application and our web application.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
