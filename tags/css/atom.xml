So this is part one of an iPhone web application piece that I am working on. While I am it, let me point out what the scope of this article is. This article is not about how to write an iPhone web application. It does not go into details on the syntax or use of technologies for the iPhone. It does explain some of the misconceptions between iPhone applications, iPhone targeted websites, and finally, iPhone Web Applications. I do plan to write more about the iPhone web application technologies and provide some examples and working code, but that is all currently beyond the scope of this article.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While researching on the topic over the last few weeks, I discovered what I believe is a misconception of an iPhone web application, and my goal is to hopefully, clear things up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let’s start by defining some of the possible ways of targeting an iPhone user, which actually diverges into two separate categories of its own. The first and probably the most popular way of targeting an iPhone user is through an iPhone app, sold through the iTunes App store. Coding and compiling Objective C/Cocoa based native iPhone applications.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yet there are still other ways of creating a custom user experience for a user on the iPhone.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
