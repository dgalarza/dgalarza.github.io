            <p>Around April I started digging into iOS and Swift. I figured it would
            be helpful to share my experience with others who may also want to learn it.
            Note, this comes from the perspective of someone who already has a programming
            background and previously spent time becoming familiar with Objective-C and
            Apple&#39;s Cocoa Touch frameworks.</p>
            
            <p>When I first got started, I decided to search for some online iOS with Swift
            courses. I was hoping to find some courses on Code School or something similar.
            Unfortunately, I couldn&#39;t find a course like this. The courses that I found
            were focused around learning iOS with Objective-C. I decided if I was going to
            start learning iOS, I wanted to learn it with the modern Swift language rather
            than Objective-C.</p>
            
            <p>That&#39;s not to say that having Objective-C knowledge isn&#39;t valuable. It&#39;s
            especially important to have Objective-C experience to work with older
            applications. For example, <a href="http://troposweather.com/">Tropos</a> is built with
            Objective-C. In order to contribute to this project, I needed to think back to
            my Objective-C learnings. The specifics around iOS development tend to be the
            frameworks that Apple provides to its developers. These frameworks have great
            documentation and are in both, Swift and Objective-C. If you&#39;re learning how to
            use these libraries and the concepts behind iOS, it shouldn&#39;t be difficult to
            apply them to Objective-C.</p>
            
            <p>Initially I was disappointed to see that there weren&#39;t many resources to get
            started in iOS from a beginner&#39;s perspective with Swift. Then after spending
            some more time searching I found that Stanford University has a free course on
            iTunes university titled <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/developing-ios-8-apps-swift/id961180099">Developing iOS 8 Apps with
            Swift</a>.
            This has been an immensely useful resource. Paul Hegarty is a great instructor.
            He is really good at explaining the concepts and demonstrating things in real
            time. I highly recommend checking it out.</p>
            
            <p>These are a few of the important things I&#39;ve learned so far:</p>
            
            <ul>
            <li><p><strong><a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/">Read the iOS Human Interface
            Guidelines</a></strong>
            This may go without saying but Apple has done a ton of research behind the
            user experience of iOS and its native applications. A fun fact that I learned
            was the loading screen for an iOS application shouldn&#39;t be used as a splash
            page. Instead, it should be a representation of the inactive application to
            give the illusion of a quick load.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Have a project idea</strong> While reading and following the Stanford online course
            was immensely useful to start learning, I always feel that I need a concrete
            project to work on to apply my learnings. Without this, I usually can&#39;t keep
            sustained interest. I recommend coming up with a simple app idea to work on
            while learning.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Read through Apple&#39;s developer documentation</strong> While developing for iOS you
            have a large number of frameworks provided by Apple at your disposal.
            Apple also provides excellent documentation around all of these frameworks;
            XCode even has a documentation browser built in. I recommend taking the time
            to familiarize yourself with these documents and learn to navigate them, it
            will be a huge benefit in the long run.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Use the Apple developer forums</strong> I wasn&#39;t immediately aware of how useful
            the Apple developer forums would be. I was running into trouble getting an
            archive of my app sent to iTunes connect and spent hours if not days searching
            for support. Most of my searching turned up various StackOverflow posts which
            were not helpful, but after checking in the thoughtbot XCode slack channel I
            found that someone else had recently run into a similar issue. They lead me to
            the specific post on the Apple developer forums regarding the issue and I was
            able to work around it in a few minutes. Lesson I learned; search the Apple
            developer forums.</p></li>
